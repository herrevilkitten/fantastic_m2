1. Sees the player doing something fishy
- Checks if anyone has noted suspicious character
-- if first time caught, then cop will follow for 5 seconds. Increase suspicion level by 5
-- if second time caught, then cop will follow for 10 seconds. Increase suspicion level by 10
-- if third time caught, then cop will call reinforcement and arrrest you

-- if no, cop will observe and note suspicions character

=====

If (IsPlayerInteractingWithObject) {
	
	//start observing
	if (last time observed player NEAR (within a range of) position and interacting with the object > 25 seconds ago || never seen player interact here) {
		startOfObservation = currentTime;
		storePlayerLastLocationAndTime
		currentAction = observe;
		return success;
	} else if ((startOfObservation + 2 < currentTime) && currentAction = observe) {
		increaseDetectionScore (5*numberOfTimesObserved)
		If (DetectionScore > 50) {
			currentAction = callBackupForArrest
			call in position + velocity 
		} else {
			currentAction = patrol;
		}
	}
}
	
If (!IsPlayerInteractingWithObject) {
	currentAction = patrol
}
	




If cop is currently observing... 
	//same cop observed for longer than 3 seconds doing the same behavior
	if currentAction == observe AND should I report suspicious behavior
		call in behavior to dispatcher (dispatcher increases suspicion score)
	
		
	
If cop is not observing...
	start observing
